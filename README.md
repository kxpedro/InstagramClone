# Instagram Clone

Web Aplication using de architecture RESTful based on Instragram using Node.js  

The objective of this was to work with the post, feed and comentaries just like the Instagram (It doesnt have an login/sigin).  

To use the application, run the server.js file in the /api directory and the app.js file in the /instagram_clone directory.  
The app.js is located in localhost and its using the server.js locate in 8080.  

That's it, it could be much better...
